        - heading "Varun Bhardwaj" [level=1] [ref=e22]
        - paragraph [ref=e23]: Senior Quality Engineering Leader with a background in building and coaching quality practices in complex teams. Interested in systems thinking, AI, and human judgment in software delivery.

        - generic [ref=e30]:
          - heading "Quality as a System Property" [level=3] [ref=e31]
          - paragraph [ref=e32]: I see quality as an emergent property of the entire system, not a specific phase of development or the responsibility of a single role. My focus is on understanding the system as a whole, including its feedback loops and second-order effects, to identify where quality is either created or degraded.
        - generic [ref=e33]:
          - heading "Approach to Delivery" [level=3] [ref=e34]
          - paragraph [ref=e35]: My approach to delivery prioritizes rapid learning and adaptation. I optimize for fast feedback loops that provide clear signals, rather than relying on processes that create a false sense of certainty. I believe that confidence in delivery should be earned through tangible evidence and system visibility, not by gating progress through rigid checkpoints.
        - generic [ref=e36]:
          - heading "Trade-offs and Risk" [level=3] [ref=e37]
          - paragraph [ref=e38]: I am comfortable navigating trade-offs, as they are an inherent part of any complex project. However, I am uncomfortable with hidden or unacknowledged risks. My goal is to make risks visible and explicit, so that we can make informed decisions about them.
        - generic [ref=e39]:
          - heading "AI and Human Judgment" [level=3] [ref=e40]
          - paragraph [ref=e41]: I believe that AI should be used to amplify human judgment, not to replace human thinking. In areas where judgment, ethics, and context are critical, I advocate for keeping humans in the loop. AI's role is to augment our capabilities, not to automate our responsibilities.
    - generic [ref=e45]:
      - heading "What I Do" [level=2] [ref=e46]
      - paragraph [ref=e47]: "My work focuses on shifting teams from a traditional, assurance-heavy approach to a more dynamic, confidence-driven model of delivery. I achieve this by focusing on several key areas:"

        - generic [ref=e49]:
          - heading "Designing Feedback Loops" [level=3] [ref=e50]
          - paragraph [ref=e51]: I design and implement feedback mechanisms that surface risks and quality issues early in the development process, allowing for rapid course correction.
        - generic [ref=e52]:
          - heading "Identifying System Bottlenecks" [level=3] [ref=e53]
          - paragraph [ref=e54]: I have a knack for identifying the often-normalized bottlenecks in a team's workflow that hinder quality and slow down delivery.
        - generic [ref=e55]:
          - heading "Translating Quality into Business Terms" [level=3] [ref=e56]
          - paragraph [ref=e57]: I bridge the gap between technical quality concerns and business objectives, translating complex quality issues into language that leaders can understand and act upon.
        - generic [ref=e58]:
          - heading "Fostering a Culture of Ownership" [level=3] [ref=e59]
          - paragraph [ref=e60]: I coach teams to take collective ownership of quality, rather than outsourcing it to a specific person or department.
        - generic [ref=e61]:
          - heading "Using Automation as an Enabler" [level=3] [ref=e62]
          - paragraph [ref=e63]: I view automation as a powerful enabler of quality, not as the end goal in itself. My focus is on using automation strategically to create leverage.
        - generic [ref=e64]:
          - heading "Driving Cross-Functional Alignment" [level=3] [ref=e65]
          - paragraph [ref=e66]: I work to create strong alignment between product, engineering, and quality, ensuring that everyone is working together towards the same definition of a high-quality product.

              - text: I believe that quality is not the job of one person or team, but a collective responsibility shared by everyone involved in building a product.
            - paragraph [ref=e82]:
              - strong [ref=e83]: "Learning beats blaming:"
              - text: When things go wrong, my focus is on understanding the root cause and learning from it, not on assigning blame.

              - strong [ref=e91]: "Evidence over opinion:"
